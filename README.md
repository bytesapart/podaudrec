# Podaudrec - A simple, intuitive GUI for recording voice locally.

A simple Python based audio recorder - for local, non-exclusive audio recording. Repo based off of [PyShine's PyQT based spectrum analyzer](https://pyshine.com/PyQt5-Live-Audio-GUI-with-Start-and-Stop/).

This project tries to have a localised audio recording for guests who are somewhat technically savy, and avoids the route of Squadcast.fm or Riverside.fm which, for a start, costs some money as an upfront payment and secondly stores the recordings on their own cloud, which is a red flag in corporate settings where recordings for podcasts have to be internalised.

Hence, since your guest is a little technically adept, she/he can follow a bunch of steps and have a very simple GUI to record locally, therefore improving the overall quality of the podcast.
